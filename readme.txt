This plugin allow you to see the product details in Woocommerce when you pass the mouse on the product.

== Description ==

When you enter the product page in Woocommerce, in addition to the price, the number of units, images, ... of that product, you can also see additional information, such as weight, dimensions or any type of information you have wanted give the seller.

But, why do you have to enter the product file to see that additional information? Would not it be more convenient for the user to see it first to know if he is still interested in the product or not?

For this reason I developed this plugin. Hover Product Details will allow you, passing the mouse over each product of the store, see the additional information without having to enter the product page. In this way, your users will save time and be satisfied with you.
